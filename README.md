# Staging seed for app main

This directory contains seed data for the app main. The seed data is used to populate the "database" (aka Git) with initial data when the app is deployed.

The seed data is stored in the `db/seed` directory from [source repo](https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/pages-legales-faciles).
